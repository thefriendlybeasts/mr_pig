Mr. Pig is a YAML-configurable [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) setup for [Statamic](http://statamic.com/), complete with deployments. It aims to simplify using Grunt in your Statamic projects to the point that you don’t need to understand how Grunt works.

*I do however recommend gaining a fuller understanding.*





# Features
- Live reload
- Minification and concatenation of JavaScript/CSS
- Image optimization
- CSS post-processing to removed unused CSS (Extremely helpful with frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation) and add vendor prefixes
- Deployments via Git (requires shell access to your server **OR** DeployBot account)





# Benefits
- Develop and test faster
- Serve fewer and smaller files
- Hakuna matata





# Installation
Mr. Pig requires that you have Grunt installed, which requires that you have npm installed. Dependencies! Don’t worry, we’ll walk you through it. If you already have Grunt and npm installed, skip ahead to [Installing Mr. Pig](#installing-mr-pig).

**Note: This may seem complicated, but after setting it up a time or two, you’ll see it’s really not so hard.**

**You only have to install Grunt and npm the first time.**

If you have trouble with these instructions, get the instructions straight from the boar’s mouth:

- [Installing npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
- [Installing Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)


## Installing npm
npm is the package manager (think Bower) for Node.js, so installing npm is really a by-product of installing Node.js.

Just visit the [Node.js site](http://nodejs.org/) and click the wonderfully-lime “Install” button to download an installer and run it.


## Installing Grunt
[Grunt’s recommended setup](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) is to install the CLI globally and the task runner on a per-project basis. You’ll only have to install the CLI once and installing Mr. Pig will take care of the task runner for you.

To install the Grunt CLI, run the following command in Terminal (or whatever crazy command shell you might use).

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

If it doesn’t work the first time, you probably need to use `sudo`, which means to `do` something as a `s`uper`u`ser. If you need to install with `sudo`, it’ll ask for your password. You won’t see any characters pop up on the screen when you type it in. That’s normal.

## Installing Mr. Pig
Download the latest version and drop the files in your project directory.

<aside>
In order to keep things organized, Mr. Pig is designed to be installed above-root by default.

```
mr_pig/
html/
  _add-ons/
  _app
  _config
  …
Gruntfile.js
package.json
```

If you prefer a sty of directories, open `mr_pig/mr_pig.yaml`, and change `local: html` -> `local: ./`.
</aside>

Once everything is in place, you can run `npm install`, which will read `package.json` and install the necessary Grunt plugins / Node packages.

```shell
cd ~/Sites/my-project
npm install
```


## Gitignore
Make sure you ignore `mr_pig/mr_pig.preferences.yaml` and `node_modules`.

`mr_pig.preferences.yaml` is developer-specific so shouldn't be committed to a repo that more than one person works on.

You should never, ever, ever, ever, ever edit anything in `node_modules` and it's all installed by simply running `npm install`, so there's no reason to track it in your repo.





# Usage
## During development
In Terminal, navigate to your project folder and run `grunt serve`.

```shell
cd ~/Sites/my-project
grunt serve
```

This will run the default Grunt task which opens your site up in your preferred browser and reloads the page/CSS when you make changes.

Because Mr. Pig uses [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/), you can also open your site up on any device on the same network. Just use the URL provided to you in Terminal after you run `grunt` (http://10.10.10.108:3000 in this case).

```shell
Running "browserSync:dev" (browserSync) task
[BS] [info] Proxying: http://localhost:8080
[BS] Access URLs:
 -------------------------------------
       Local: http://localhost:3000
    External: http://10.10.10.123:3000
 -------------------------------------
          UI: http://localhost:3001
 UI External: http://10.10.10.123:3001
 -------------------------------------
[BS] Watching files...

Running "watch" task
Waiting...
```

The coolest thing about BrowserSync is that, by default, whatever you do on one device will happen on all other devices accessing the site. Visit the UI URL (http://localhost:3001, in this case) to configure some other cool stuff. A few things of note are CSS Outlining, CSS Depth Outlining, and a customizable Overlay CSS Grid, all under the **Remote Debug** tab.

## Building
When you’re ready to push changes to a live server / test the built version of your site, just run `grunt build` in your project folder.

```shell
cd ~/Sites/my-project
grunt build
```

This will create a new folder next to `html` that you can easily upload to your server or serve via [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (check out our [Vagrant setup for Statamic](https://github.com/thefriendlybeasts/vagrant-statamic)), MAMP, XAMP, or whatever you use to run a local server.





# Configuration
## Browser and URL
By default, Mr. Pig will open your site in Google Chrome Canary and use the URL http://localhost:8080 (this is where you would access your site if you used our [Vagrant setup for Statamic](https://github.com/thefriendlybeasts/vagrant-statamic)). If you prefer another browser or URL, simply open `mr_pig/mr_pig.preferences.yaml` and update the values to your liking.

Technically, any option in `mr_pig.yaml` can be overridden in `mr_pig.preferences.yaml`, but you should almost **never** do this (and it's not supported). For most sites, you want all settings in `mr_pig.yaml` to be shared by everyone working on the site. `mr_pig.preferences.yaml`, on the other hand, is for personal preferences that do not affect other developers.


## Deployments
### Git
Look for the instructions under `buildcontrol` in `mr_pig/mr_pig.yaml`.

### DeployBot
To deploy via DeployBot, open each file in `mr_pig/scripts/deploybot` and check out the comments at the top to learn how to use it.


## Everything else
Open `mr_pig/mr_pig.yaml` and take a look at the settings. Each setting is documented in comments alongside the setting itself.


## Files and paths
Grunt allows [globbing](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#globbing-patterns), to make specifying files and paths more practical. Some examples of this can be seen under `copy`.

```yaml
copy:
  src:
    - assets/**/*.{jpg,jpeg,png,gif}
    - '!assets/img/resized/*.{jpg,jpeg,png,gif}'
    - {apple-touch-icon,favicon,mstile}*
```

- `*` matches any number of characters that aren't `/`.
- `**` is just like `*`, except that it's recursive.
- `{}` matches anything contained inside separated by commas.
- `!` means not.

So `assets/**/*.{jpg,jpeg,png,gif}` will grab any `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, or `gif` anywhere in the `assets` folder.

…but `!assets/img/resized/*.{jpg,jpeg,png,gif}` tells Grunt to ignore any of those files if they're in the `resized` folder. That's where Statamic saves [transformed](http://statamic.com/learn/documentation/tags/transform) images.

`{apple-touch-icon,favicon,mstile}*` looks for any file in the root that begins with `apple-touch-icon`, `favicon`, or `mstile`.
